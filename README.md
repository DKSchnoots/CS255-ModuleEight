1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass company wanted to develop a platform geared toward assisting individuals to pass their driving exams successfully on their initial try. Their objective was to establish a tiered user system that could grant access to a variety of educational materials. Additionally, users would have the ability to schedule in-person training sessions and behind-the-wheel lessons with certified instructors. The system was designed to streamline these functions and grant administrators the capability to deactivate packages they no longer wished to provide.
2. What did you do particularly well?
I am confident that I effectively condensed the project's requirements into well-defined use cases. I transformed the interview notes into comprehensive use cases, clearly delineating the extent and include relationships. Additionally, I carefully charted the access privileges for different functions, and I believe the result is highly successful.
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my sequence diagram, probably starting by conducting additional research on best practices for creating them to ensure a more refined version. My motivation for this is that, as it stands, I have what I believe are two "alternative" sections nested within a parent "alternative" section. In coding terms, this would resemble nested loops, but I'm uncertain whether this is suitable for a sequence diagram. My goal would be to simplify this by breaking it down into a sequence of single choices and employing a more detailed, step-by-step approach to depict the entire process.
4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I initiated the process by thoroughly reviewing the interview transcript. Any statements made by the interviewees that could be construed as project deliverables were meticulously recorded. Once I had compiled a comprehensive list, I began to contemplate how these deliverables could be implemented through software or if they necessitated external solutions. In cases where the requirement was clearly external, I set it aside and concentrated on those that could be directly applied within the software. When confronted with abstract requirements, such as "security," I often resorted to research to identify the most suitable solutions. Subsequently, I set off on the task of incorporating these requirements into the software design. To achieve this, I aimed to break them down into their most fundamental tasks and formulated use cases for each of them. To reintroduce complexity where needed, I reintegrated the "include" and "extend" relationships. Designing with the user's needs in mind is paramount because it ensures that the final product aligns with the client's actual requests. For instance, in this project, one key consideration was making downloadable content accessible exclusively to certain user tiers. Failing to incorporate a login or a tiered user system would have resulted in content being available for download by anyone, thereby undermining the core purpose of offering "premium" content. Factoring in the user's requirements during the design phase not only reduces the risk of extensive rework but also contributes to client satisfaction.
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
As a novice in software development, my approach typically involves several key steps. I start by thoroughly reviewing the requirements, and as I do, I create a checklist of what I consider to be the essential elements. Next, I focus on identifying the system's components and their interactions. Occasionally, I employ a UML Class Diagram for this task, but sometimes I simply make informal notes before moving on to create a process diagram. Once I have both a process diagram and a class diagram in place, I then proceed to the software development phase. Creating these diagrams is a valuable part of my process because it helps me uncover aspects that I might overlook if I were to dive directly into coding. However, in certain situations, especially in school where time constraints can be challenging, I find myself compelled to skip the diagramming step and jump directly into coding. In the future, I anticipate making more extensive use of activity diagrams to outline the expected functionality of functions. I believe that these diagrams serve as a valuable tool to ensure that functions perform as intended.
